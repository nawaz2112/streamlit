Hotel Management System is a system that provides us to reserving rooms, checking
whether the rooms are vacant are or not etc by using software. This system is very useful
to all especially for business people. For Business people they donâ€™t have sufficient time
for these then they can use these types of Hotel Management Systems. By this project we
will reduce the faults in bills of their expenditure and decrease time of delay to give the
bills to the customers. We can also save the bills of the customer. By this project we can
also include all the taxes on the bills according to their expenditures. It has a scope to
reduce the errors in making the bills. Computerized bill can be printed within fraction of
seconds. Booking is possible by using this software. This Project is based on python. If
anyone wants to book the room for few days then they can specify the specific number by
seeing the types of rooms we have. The bill of this booking is based on the type of room
